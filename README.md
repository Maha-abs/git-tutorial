# Columns

### Manufacturer name (Mh, MAN, MMS)
- **EU standard denomination (Mh)**
- **Manufacturer denomination (MAN)**
- **National Registry denomination (MMS)**

### Type approval number (TAN)
The TAN should consist of four sections, each separated by the '*'-character. Except for the lower case letter 'e' and, in case of small series or national type-approvals, the letters 'KS', resp. 'NKS', the TAN must include numbers and asterisks only. Please ensure that where the number '0' should be used, that it is not replaced by the letter ‘O’.

### Type (T), Variant (Va) and Version (Ve)
These three parameters allow identifying the data relating to the same version of the vehicle delivered from different Member States.

### Make (Mk)
The make of the vehicle 

### Commercial name (Cn)
 This is a mandatory parameter for M1 vehicles but as the commercial name can be used to further identify the manufacturer and the vehicle record, Member States are asked to provide this parameter on a voluntary basis for the N1 monitoring.

### Category of the vehicle type approved (Ct)
Category of the vehicle type approved. see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_category

- **M1**: Vehicles used for carriage of passengers, comprising not more than eight seats in addition to the driver's = 9.( Larger Than Standard Car e.g.: London Cab / E7 Type Vehicle 8 seat + Driver.)
- **M1G**: An off-road vehicle (ORV), sometimes referred to as an off-highway vehicle (OHV), overland vehicle, or adventure vehicle. see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-road_vehicle
- **N1**: Vehicles used for the carriage of goods and having a maximum mass not exceeding 3.5 tonnes. (Pick-up Truck, Van)

### Registrations (r)
The data entry for this field will by default be '1' since each vehicle will be reported separately.

### CO2 Emissions (E)

### Mass in running order (m)
Mass in running order (m) is used for the calculation of the specific emission target of a manufacturer. Mass in running order refers to the mass of the vehicle with bodywork in running order, i.e. the vehicle with its fuel tank(s) filled to at least 90 % of its or their capacity/ies, including the mass of the driver, of the fuel and liquids, fitted with the standard equipment in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications and, when they are fitted, the mass of the bodywork, 
the cabin, the coupling and the spare wheel(s) as well as the tools (Regulation (EU) No 1230/2012).

It should be noted that the mass in running order is different from the actual mass of the vehicle. The mass in running order is set out in section 13 of the CoC.

### Wheelbase (w), track width of steering axle (at1), track width of 
other axles (at2)
The wheelbase is specified in section 4 of the certificate of conformity.
Foot-print - axle track(s) are specified in section 30 of the certificate of conformity. In case the front and rear axle have different widths, the maximum value should be reported.

### Fuel type (Ft) and Fuel mode (Fm)
Fuel type is specified in section 26 of the certificate of conformity. 
Fuel mode is specified in section 26.1 of the certificate of conformity.
For the fuel mode the permitted entries are:

- **"M"** for mono-fuel vehicles, i.e. vehicles able to run on only one fuel, either petrol, diesel, LPG, natural gas (NG) or hydrogen. The latter category also covers Fuel Cell electric vehicles, i.e. vehicles equipped with a powertrain containing exclusively fuel cell(s) and electric machine(s) as propulsion energy converter(s).
  
- **"B"** for bi-fuel vehicles, i.e. vehicles with two separate fuel storage systems, which are designed to run primarily on only one fuel at a time. This covers vehicles that can run on petrol and either LPG, NG/biomethane or hydrogen. 
- **“F”** for flex-fuel vehicles, i.e. vehicles with one fuel storage system that can run on different mixtures of two or more fuels; this concerns more specifically ‘flex fuel ethanol vehicles’, which can run on petrol or a mixture of petrol and ethanol up to an 85 per cent ethanol blend (E85); 
- **"E"** for battery electric vehicles (BEV), i.e. "pure" electric vehicles (NOT hybrid vehicles). These vehicles can be identified using section 23 of the certificate of conformity. 
- **“P”** for Off vehicle charging hybrid electric vehicles (OVC-HEV), i.e. plug-in hybrid vehicles. These vehicles can be identified using section 23.1 of the certificate of conformity. Their weighted average CO2 values are specified in section 49.1. (NEDC) and section 49.4 (WLTP) of the certificate of conformity. 
- **“H”** for Not-Off vehicle charging hybrid electric vehicles (NOVC-HEV). These vehicles can be identified using section 23.1 of the certificate of conformity. They cannot take electric energy from external sources and are only fuelled with one of fuel types specified in section 26 of the CoC. The CO2 values for that fuel shall be reported.


 Fuel combination | Fuel type to be reported | Fuel mode to be reported | Fuel for which the CO2 value should be taken (entry "combined" except where mentioned otherwise)|
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Petrol  | Petrol  | M | Petrol |
| Diesel  | Diesel  | M | Diesel |
| LPG  | LPG  | M | LPG |
| Natural Gas (NG) | NG | M | NG |
| Hydrogen | Hydrogen | M | Hydrogen In case of Fuel Cell vehicles, the value is zero.|
| Petrol-LPG | LPG | B | NG |
| Petrol-NG | NG-biomethane | B | NG |
| Petrol-hydrogen | Hydrogen | B | Hydrogen |
| Petrol-E85 | E85 | F | Petrol |
| Electric | Electric | E | CO2 emission value is zero |
| Off vehicle charging hybrid electric vehicle (OVC-HEV) (Plug-in hybrid) | Fuel type combination with electricity, e.g. Petrol/Electric; or E85/Electric; or Diesel/Electric;or Hydrogen/Electric | P | Weighted, combined CO2 value (CoC should contain only this value) |
| Not off-vehicle charging hybrid electric vehicle (NOVC-HEV)(Non plug-in hybrid) | Fuel type stated in CoC: Petrol; or E85; or Diesel | H | Fuel type stated in CoC (CoC should contain only one value) |

### Engine capacity (Ec) and engine power (Ep)
The “engine capacity” is specified in Section 25 of the CoC. The "engine power" (i.e. the declared maximum net power) is specified in Section 27.3 of the CoC. In case of several values, the maximum value should be reported. 

### Electric energy consumption (Z)
This parameter allows identifying pure electric vehicles and OVC-HEV and provides information on their energy efficiency.

### Code of the eco-innovation(s) (IT)
Where the use of eco-innovation technologies are applied, the code of the eco-innovation or group of eco-innovations is indicated in Section 49.3.1. of the CoC. The entry should include both the code of the type approval authority involved (e.g. "e1" for the German authority) and the individual code of each eco-innovation (e.g."1").

### Emissions reduction (Er (g/km))
